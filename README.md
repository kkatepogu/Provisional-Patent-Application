Background of the Invention: 
Conventional navigation systems such as Google Maps or Apple Maps assist users in reaching destinations but do not help in remembering essential items needed based on their journey. There is currently no intelligent solution that prompts users based on contextual cues like the destination type (e.g., airport, school, workplace).

Summary of the Invention: 
This invention relates to a mobile-based system that integrates with Google Maps or Apple Maps. When the user starts navigation in a vehicle, the system captures the destination and current location in real-time, analyzes the location type (e.g., airport, hospital), and provides intelligent, voice-based or on-screen reminders for essential items (e.g., “Don't forget your passport”).
